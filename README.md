AI-Based Cosmic Rejection Event Classification for LArTPC Detectors
• Generated a large-scale dataset (3.2M+ events) utilizing Geant4 simulations to model Neutrino signal and Cosmic background interactions for
MicroBooNE-like LArTPC detectors.
• Engineered a robust data pipeline using Pandas and NumPy to process raw simulation output, performing rigorous data cleaning and preventing
data leakage by isolating truth-level variables.
• Developed and optimized a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow/Keras with techniques like Batch Normalization, Dropout, and
Class Weights to handle data imbalance.
• Achieved 99.4% Accuracy and >99% Cosmic Rejection Efficiency on the test set, establishing a high-performance baseline for future Vertex
Reconstruction and Particle Identification (PID) modules.
